# Chuck Roast

## Ingredients
3 - 4 pound piece of chuck roast meat
2 tablespoons cooking oil
Salt and pepper to taste
2 onions, peeled and chopped
2 carrots, peeled and chopped
5 cloves garlic, peeled
1/2 cup red wine (optional)

## Directions

1 Heat the oil in a dutch oven or roasting pan over medium high heat.
2 Wash the chuck roast and dry it with paper towels.
3 Set the chuck roast in the hot oil. Sear the roast on the first side until it becomes brown, then flip it over and sear the other side until brown. This will help create a crust to keep in moisture and add flavor.
4 Remove the chuck roast to a plate.
5 Place the vegetables in the dutch oven. Throw in the onions and carrots. Cook them until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic and cook for a few minutes more.
